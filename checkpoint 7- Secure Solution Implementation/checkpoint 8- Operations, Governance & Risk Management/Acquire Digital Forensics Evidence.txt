Acquire Digital Forensics Evidence

______________________________

ON THE KALI LINUX MACHINE :
______________________________

- first i'll use the lsblk command to identify the different partitions on the disk.
   * as on the video the machine as only one partition i'll focuse my forensic on it


- after using ls, i will try to use cat to list the different partition of the machine to see if there are not hidden used partion on the computer 
    * the comand used on the video is cat /proc/partitions


- in order to gather more information on the system disk we will have to use df -h command to display the input name of the drive such as sdb 

   * the command that have to be used is df -h /dev/sdb1 

it will give us info like, the pourcentage of usage of the drive, the amount of data saved in and more ...


- now in order to create a copy of the suspect disk we will use:
     * the dd command that is also use to format the disk 

    * the command used is dd if=/dev/sdb1 of=/root/suspect.img


- we have to use the md5sum command to generate a checksum and redirect it into named suspect.imh-hash

    * the command used is md5sum suspect.img > suspect.img-hash 

    * and use cat suspect.img-hash to display it's content 


- in order to mark the img disk with the actual date we will use the following command

   * echo "Today is $(date)" > suspect.img 

- now we will recalculate our data with the command md5 

   * md5sum suspect.img >> suspect.img

    * it will display to different hash because of the ">>" that set the "today's date" in an other hash 


- Then if we :
     * cat suspect.img we are supposed to see the date of our actual time

ON THE WINDOWS MACHINE :
______________________________


- instead of running the windows server manager( that we will disable) we will use 

   * autopsy used for forensics engeneering 
   * we are going to search the word forensic in it 
   * and launch /forensics - Marketing.aut
   * after launching it we have to select marketing.vhd in order to list the volums ont the machines
   * we will then find a suspicious file call viral (32) that got a desktop.ini file in his download file that is not usual 
    * after extracting the file we could find images that got multipal metadata  

   * we are also able to find the dat file that containt the different internet research of the the machine, also his email address and more personal info

- by going on the default modules on autopsy we are able to read emails sent bye the machine and also the received ones
